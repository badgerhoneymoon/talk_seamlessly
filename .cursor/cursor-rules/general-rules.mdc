# General Development Guidelines

Our project is a mobile-first web app that prioritizes precision, simplicity, and reliability.

## Core Principles

1. Execute exactly what is requested - no more, no less
2. Implement the simplest solution that fulfills all requirements
3. Minimize code complexity and line count while meeting specifications
4. Never add functionality or features that weren't explicitly requested

## Code Standards

- Avoid using `any` type - it creates build issues in Vercel
- Never use underscores to fix unused variable linter warnings
- Use shadcn components via `npx shadcn@latest add ComponentName`
- File size limit: Alert when exceeding 500 lines

## Project Maintenance

- Update ROADMAP.md after implementing new features
- Add strategic and precise logging only where critical - avoid overwhelming the code

## Development Workflow

- Development server is always running - no need for `npm run dev` commands
- When asked questions, analyze first before making code changes
- Start with core solutions before handling edge cases
- Test thoroughly after significant changes
- Focus on root causes rather than symptoms

## Mobile-First Development

- Prioritize mobile user experience
- Ensure responsive design across all components
- Test thoroughly on mobile devices and viewports

Remember: Your value comes from precision and reliability. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Am I adding any functionality or complexity that wasn't explicitly requested?"
