## How to Run and Fix Lint

1. **Run lint:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Checks the codebase for lint errors and warnings.

2. **Manually fix all issues:**
   - Open the files with warnings/errors
   - Edit the code to resolve every issue (do not ignore or suppress unless absolutely necessary)
   - Never use underscores to fix unused variable linter warnings
   - Do not rely on any autofix—manual intervention is always required

3. **Re-run lint to verify:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Ensure there are no remaining warnings or errors. Repeat manual fixes as needed.

4. **Repeat as needed:**
   Continue fixing and re-running until lint is 100% clean. No excuses—always deliver a clean result.
